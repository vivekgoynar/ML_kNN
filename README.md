The objective is to predict if a new user is an authentic user or an imposter. 
The user will enter a 4 digit passcode on the unlock app created and installed in an android phone. Now based on the speed and latency of typing, the user will be identified as a legitimate user or an imposter.

I considered a sample space of 60 entries of 10 users each. i.e. 600 inputs.

Out of them, 1 user will be a legitimate user and rest 9 will be imposters leading to a biclassfication problem.

k-Nearest neighbors(kNN) classification algorithm is used in this case.
